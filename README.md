# Disclamer
Chatgpt is a language model trained with a large set of data, but nontheless, it is not really a person and may give wrong and missleading outputs. Use it at your own risk. Do not use its advises to make financial or medical decisions as it may be wrong even if it sounds real. This is intended to help and not to replace humans and real professionals.
