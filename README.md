# Disclamer
ChatGPT is a highly advanced language model that has been trained with a vast amount of data, however, it is important to note that it is not a human being and may provide incorrect or misleading outputs. It should be used with caution and not for making critical decisions such as financial or medical choices, as it may not always be reliable despite its sophisticated capabilities. The purpose of this tool is to assist and augment human capabilities, rather than replace them. It is recommended to always consult with a qualified professional before making any important decisions.
